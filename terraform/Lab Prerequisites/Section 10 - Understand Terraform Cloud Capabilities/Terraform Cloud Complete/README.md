# My App

In this repo, you'll find a quick and easy app to get started using [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) with [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Version Control Workflow

Once multiple people are collaborating on Terraform configuration, new steps must be added to the core Terraform workflow (Write, Plan, Apply) to ensure everyone is working together smoothly. In order for different teams and individuals to be able to work on the same Terraform code, you need to use a Version Control System (VCS). The Terraform Cloud VCS or version control system workflow includes the most common steps necessary to work in a collaborative nature, but it also requires that you host the Terraform code in a VCS repository. Events on the repository will trigger workflows on Terraform Cloud. For instance, a commit to the default branch could kick off a plan and apply workflow in Terraform Cloud.
