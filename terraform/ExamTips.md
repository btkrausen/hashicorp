# Exam Tips

If you're planning to take the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate certification exam, we've put together some helpful tips that you can use to help prepare for the actual exam.

## About the Exam

The HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate exam includes multiple-choice, multi-select, and fill-in-the-blank type questions (not many of these). You'll be expected to take this proctored exam in a quiet space with a webcam enabled to ensure you are following the exam guidelines and not receiving additional assistance. The exam currently costs $70.50 and is available to take through PSI. You can register for the exams by following the outline on hashicorp.com/certifications.

## How Do I Prepare for the Exam?

There are a series of study materials and courses available that will help you to get ready for the certification exam.  This includes [HashiCorp's Certification Preperation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003) tracks as well as our own [Terraform Hands on Lab Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-hands-on-labs).  These will go through all of the exam objectives and ensure you are comfortable with all the topics that might be covered. Regardless of what study materials you register for be sure to subscribe to a course that is actively maintained, as HashiCorp frequently updates its exams.

### Hands-On Practice

Let's be honest, when it comes to Terraform, there's no better way to study and prepare than to use the product in your own environment. There is absolutely no substitution for hands-on experience with Terraform. Use the [labs](README.md) to ensure you have covered all the topics and make sure you are 100% comfortable with them. It's not enough just to do the tasks in the labs, but it is essential to understand "why" things happen the way they do when you run a `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`. Play around with the code provided in each lab and look up the commands, look up the attributes for resources. If cost is a concern, use the available providers that interact with your local system, like the `local`, `tls`, or `random` provider. Purposely break things and figure out how to fix them.

### Use Practice Questions

When you are getting comfortable with the topics presented in this exam, take a look at the practice questions that we've included in the course. These are designed to be similar to the real exam and test your knowledge on the information in each objective. It's not enough to just get them right, but know exactly WHY the correct answer is correct. Even better, know why the incorrect answers are clearly wrong. That's the real power of using practice exams to study.

When you're ready for more practice questions, check out [Bryan's practice exam](https://btk.me/tf) on Udemy. He wrote the very first practice exam for the Terraform Associate exam and it's been used by thousands of people to help prepare and pass the exam. With close to 50,000 students, it still has a 4.7 rating. If you're interested, check out [github.com/btkrausen/hashicorp](github.com/btkrausen/hashicorp) for a link and available coupons. You won't be disappointed.

### Use the HashiCorp official documentation

HashiCorp is one of the few software vendors that go to great lengths to provide you direct links where you can study for the test. If you head over to hashicorp.com/certifications and click on the Terraform Associate exam, you can find a few great links to use. 

 - The Study Guide provides a comprehensive list of links that you can use to get additional information. 
 - The [Review Guide](README.md) does a great job of breaking down each objective in the Terraform Associate exam and providing links and tutorials you can use to study that specific objective. ***Really good resource here.***
 - You can also find some practice questions on this page as well.

 The last part of the documentation suggestions are just around the official docs. If you're still feeling uneasy about some topics, go to the official documentation and start reading. They do a great job of breaking down features and how they can be used.
